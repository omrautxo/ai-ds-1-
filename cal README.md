## Calculator

The objective here is to create a straightforward Python calculator program capable of executing fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and floor division. 

## About Project

This project is a simple calculator program in Python. Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1. Define functions for basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Floor Division.

2. Display a menu for users to select an operation..

3. Prompt the user for their choice of operation and two numbers

4. Execute the selected operation using the corresponding function and display the result..

5. Offer the option to perform another calculation; exit if the user declines.

## Functions

This project is a simple calculator program written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and floor division.

It uses the following functions:

1. add(x, y): Adds two numbers.

2. subtract(x, y): Subtracts one number from another.

3. multiply(x, y): Multiplies two numbers.

4. divide(x, y): Divides one number by another.

5. floordivison(x, y): Performs floor division of one number by another.


## Result

This project give output like this:


1. Enter Choice:

```bash
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Floordivison
Enter choice (1/2/3/4/5): 4 #enter any no.

```

2. Enter 1st and 2nd Numner:

```bash
Enter first number: 30  #enter any no.
Enter second number: 45  #enter any no.

```

3. Result:

```bash
Result: 0.6666666666666666

```
